For this project I was not sure what to make. The best idea I came up with was an app that focused on a series like Harry Potter. The app would have multiple pages/views. 

I would use an API to get series information similar to the swapi api and I would present this information in my app similar to the angry birds assignment.

I would make a trivia game inside the app and I would use at least two datatbases to store the questions and answers. 

I would also try to incorporate another api, the youtube api so I can have a vidoe page.

In conclusion, I want to make a fan app for a series that will be a one stop place for all information about that series.
